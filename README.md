## Project
A-Racer is a game where you can enjoy RC car racing with your mobile phone by using AR technology to float a car track on a flat surface anytime, anywhere, beyond the constraints of time and space. 

AR RC-Car Multiplayer Racing Game is a game which gets ideas from existing RC car racing games and uses AR technology to enjoy racing by displaying car tracks on a flat surface on a mobile phone screen anytime, anywhere.
It is implemented as a multiplayer game so that two players can control the movement of the car on the track together. The advantage of AR is that you can designate and place the racing track anywhere you want to feel the realism. In the case of this game using AR, it is simple and efficient in that all players who play together need to prepare is a mobile device.
